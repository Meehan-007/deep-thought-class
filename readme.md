# Deep Thoughts App

## description:
Deep Thoughts is a social media application that enables users to share their thoughts with others by creating posts, which can then be reacted to or commented on by other users. This platform allows for the exchange of ideas and opinions in a collaborative environment, facilitating conversations and promoting engagement among its users. The source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

## Deployment:
https://deep-thoughts-are-real.herokuapp.com/

## Installiation:
To use the app, simply clone the GitHub repository and run "npm install" followed by "npm start" to start the server.

## Code and Technologies:
The app is built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express.js, and React.

## Licenses:
The source code is licensed under the MIT license.

## Features:
It has a sign-up feature and login capabilities. Users can write comments to other users, and their profile will also track all their posts and friends. Right now, you can only view your profile page, but later I would like to enable viewing other users' pages, as well as allowing users to add friends to their friend list.
